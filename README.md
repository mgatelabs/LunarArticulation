# LunarArticulation

## Big Idea
This software when used properly will become primary repository for your localized text.

## Why?
Localizing an iOS app is hard and no fun.  The available tools are basic and require you to do a lot of the grunt work.  I wanted a tool, where I can spend more time developing and less tinkering with large strings files.

## How?
This software will execute genstrings, parse the results and provide ways for you extract and insert localized values.

## Setup
It needs a working folder, with a “db”, “temp” and “bin” folder.
